# diagrams-app
Repository for diagrams application.

All diagrams I drew with [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net) are storaged in this repository. The source codes (with suffix '.drawio') are storaged in the `src` folder, and the exported images are storaged in the `img` folder. 

Thanks for [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net) so that I can draw the professional and beautiful diagrams.
